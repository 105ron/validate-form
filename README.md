# HTML forms validation with Javascript

Build a HTML form which collects Email, Email Confirmation, Country, Zip Code, Password and Password Confirmation fields. It should use live inline validation to inform the user whether a field is properly filled in or not. That means highlighting a field red and providing a helpful error message until it has been filled in properly.

This is part of [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) JavaScript track. See [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript-and-jquery/lessons/validating-a-form-with-jquery?ref=lnav) for more information.
